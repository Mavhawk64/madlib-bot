Putting on a newscast might look easy, but it takes a lot of _adj1_ work. Go behind the scenes, and you'll see dozens of _adj2_ workders _v(ing)_ in every direction! Reporters run back and forth between the studio and locations all around (the) _place_ to cover _adj3_ stories and interview _plural1_. They are joined by videographers who operate handheld _plural2_ to capture all the action. The anchors are the people who _v1_ behind the news deck and read the stories during the newscast. They have to look _adj4_ on air, so they can often be found getting makeup applied to their _body part plural_. The director tells everyone where and when to _v2_. It's easy to spot a director because he wears a headset on his _body part_ and yells things like "Camera two!" and "Cut to commercial!" and "_silly_!" A newscast is live television, so if you make a/an _adj5_ mistake, everyone watching at home on their _plural3_ will know!
